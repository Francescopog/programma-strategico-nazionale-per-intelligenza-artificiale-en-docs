Governance
==========

Digital transformations involve all aspects of policy and cannot be managed by individual administrations alone. This
implies that strategies such as this one need powerful coordination mechanisms to be monitored and made effective.

To that end, the Ministers of University and Research, Economic Development and Technological Innovation and
Digital Transition will create a permanent AI steering group within the Digital Transition Interministerial Committee to
direct, monitor and evaluate the implementation of this strategy, its subsequent iterations as well as coordinate all
policy actions on AI going forward. This implies the possibility of involving other institutional players, research and
academic circles and representatives from the private sector.
